# OperatorOverloading
## Problem Statement
Create a class ‘length’ with the following members:
private:
int feet;
int inches;
public:
void readData();
void showData();
Write an overloaded operator function for operator ‘<’ (less than) that compares
two objects Ob1 and Ob2 of class ‘length’ type and returns 1 if two objects length is
same, and 0 otherwise.
